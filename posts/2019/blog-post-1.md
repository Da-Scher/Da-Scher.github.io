Eleventy is super fresh init.  
I think that the coolest thing about 11ty is the ease of use and the speed in making a bunch of static websites on the cheap and quick side.  
Current goal: get my own stylesheet and layouts to isolate myself from JonUK's eleventy-blog project (not that I am ungrateful, thanks dude!).   
My next achievement is getting passed the physics classes so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about physics.
